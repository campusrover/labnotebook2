# RL-Trained Object Picker

* Sonny George & Alex Danilkovas

* ROS version: Noetic

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Using Gazebo simulations, can we prototype an object-picking reinforment learning loop for a **simple** task that generalizes to the real px100 robot arm?

### Relevant Literature

For a primer on reinforcement and imitation learning in robotics, see [this FAQ](reinforcement_learning_&_imitation_learning.md).

For a primer on the Python `gymnasium` package, see [this FAQ](python_gymnasium_for_rl.md).

## Specification of What Was Created

Our codebase is structured as follows:

└── 📄 run.py
```

To be included:
1. Technical descriptions, illustrations
2. Discussion of interesting algorithms, modules, techniques
3. Guide on how to use the code written
4. Tables listing names and one sentence purpose of each of these:
    - Python source files
    - Nodes created
    - Topics and their messages
