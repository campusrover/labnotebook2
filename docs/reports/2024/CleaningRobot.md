### Final Demo Setup: A Modular Network-Enabled Cleaning System

For the final demonstration, we will replicate a realistic cleaning scenario in a controlled environment. The setup ensures seamless communication and modular scalability, simulating a robust system for future multi-robot collaboration.

**Hardware Configuration:**

* TurtleBot3 (Cleaning Robot)
  * Role: A single cleaning robot performing mapping, exploration, and cleaning tasks.
  * Connectivity: Communicates with the central system via the router's local network.
* No Internet Access Local Network Router (Network Center)
  * Role: Acts as the network center to establish a local LAN for communication.
  * Features: Provides stable IP addresses for devices, enabling consistent communication across the network.
* Computer with Linux OS (Computing Center and Control Terminal):
  * Role: Acts as the central computing tower and the portable control panel
    * Running the GUI control panel, represents portable control panel
    * Managing mapping, exploration, and cleaning processes
    * Collecting and visualizing data in real-time.

**Benefits of the Setup:**

* Flexibility: Easy to transport and test in various locations with no dependency on external networks.
* Security: Local network ensures data is contained within the system, reducing security risks.
* Scalability: Paves the way for testing more complex, multi-robot systems in the same architecture.

## **Getting Started**

### **Program Entry**

To start the program:

1. **For Simulation**:

  Remember to set localhost settings in ~/.bashrc

```bash
   roslaunch control_panel panel_sim.launch
```

  No additional commands are required for simulation environment, this launch file handles all controls.

2. **For Real Robot**:

  Remember to set real IP settings in ~/.bashrc and update turtlebot3's settings.

  For Real Environment, you need to run roscore on PC firstly:

```bash
roscore
```

  Before bringup, if the environment has no Internet access, or no RTC module on turtlebot3, you need sync time.

  For Real Environment, you need to ssh to turtlebot3 and bring up it secondly:

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch
```

  After above instructions, you can now run the panel to start the program:

```bash
   roslaunch control_panel panel_real.launch
```

  After running, you must do following to avoid data loss or hardware damage:

```bash
sudo shutdown -h now
```

  Visualization Markers:

  🔵 Blue Points (Frontier Exploration Markers)

  Technical Meaning: Valid frontier points indicating unexplored boundaries
  Simple Description: These points show the boundary between mapped and unmapped areas - like a border between known and unknown territory on a map. They are the potential areas for the robot to explore next.

  🔴 Red Points (Frontier Exploration Markers, Not showned on demo)

  Technical Meaning: Blacklisted frontier points that failed exploration attempts
  Simple Description: These are "no-go" areas that the robot tried to reach before but couldn't. Think of them like marking an X on a map where there might be obstacles or unreachable spots.

  🟢 Green Spheres (Frontier Exploration Markers)

  Technical Meaning: Initial points of frontiers, with sphere size inversely proportional to frontier cost
  Simple Description: These balls mark the starting points of unexplored areas. The bigger the ball, the more interesting that area is for exploration - like highlighting the most promising spots on a treasure map.

  🟣 Pink Path (Path Planning Markers, 0.05 width)

  Technical Meaning: Global plan from DWAPlannerROS (/move_base/DWAPlannerROS/global_plan)
  Simple Description: This is like the overall route plan on a GPS - it shows the complete path the robot plans to take from its current location to its destination.

  💛 Yellow Path (Path Planning Markers, 0.03 width)

  Technical Meaning: Local plan from DWAPlannerROS (/move_base/DWAPlannerROS/local_plan)
  Simple Description: This is like watching your next few steps carefully - it shows the immediate path the robot plans to take while paying attention to nearby obstacles and adjusting its movement.

  3. **Save Map**: Saves the map as `.pgm` and `.yaml` files in the `/maps` directory.

### **4-1. Cleaning Module I**

- **Developer**: Zhenxu Chen
- **Description**:
  - Based on the **CCPP package** for full-coverage path planning and cleaning.
  - Utilizes `move_base` for navigation.
- Note: `<Cleaning Module I>` is developed at branch `backup`
- CCPP Package: https://wiki.ros.org/full_coverage_path_planner
  - The CCPP package will use saved map to plan a full coverage route and allow the robot following the route.

### **4-2. Cleaning Module II**

- **Developer**: Pang Liu
- **Description**:
  - Fully self-designed cleaning functionality split into two submodules:
    - **Route Analysis Submodule**:
      - Reads saved maps and analyzes routes using a three-value map (-1 for obstacles, 0 for uncleaned areas, 1 for cleaned areas).
      - Plans paths using sampling intervals and a greedy algorithm to find valid connections.
    - **Route Follow Submodule**:
      - Executes the planned path, marking cleaned areas in real-time (still under debugging).

#### **Sub Module I: Route Analysis**

- **Detailed introduction of `route_plan.py` (core script):**

  1. Get the latest map (map data of `OccupancyGrid` message type) through `/map` topic.

  - <img src="CleaningRobot_Pictures/slam_5_saved_map_check.png" alt="GUI Screenshot" width="300">

  2. Convert `OccupancyGrid` data to a grid map represented by a NumPy array.
  3. Perform obstacle expansion on the map (taking into account the safety distance of the robot).

  - <img src="CleaningRobot_Pictures/route_analysis_1.png" alt="GUI Screenshot" width="300">

  4. **Generate a three-value map**: `-1`, `0`, and `1` are used to represent obstacles, unvisited areas, and visited areas respectively.
  5. Generate path points in the map through a fixed sampling interval. Each path point includes world coordinates and grid coordinates.
  6. Use **greedy algorithm** to find valid connections between path points and check whether there are obstacles between two points.

  - <img src="CleaningRobot_Pictures/route_analysis_2.png" alt="GUI Screenshot" width="300">
- **After the connection is completed:**

  - Use `matplotlib` to draw the path points and connected line segments and save them as an image.
  - **The logic of finding valid connections:**
    - Each path point can only be connected to the path points adjacent to it.
    - **Definition of connection:** up, down, left, and right.
    - Isolated path points are not considered in the connection.
- Use RViz and route_show (button [Show Route]) to see the points and route:

  - <img src="CleaningRobot_Pictures/route_analysis_3.png" alt="GUI Screenshot" width="400">
  - <img src="CleaningRobot_Pictures/route_analysis_4.png" alt="GUI Screenshot" width="400">

#### **Sub Module II: Route Follow**

- **Main Logic**

  - (1) Follow the route based on route_plan analyzed
  - (2) When reach a red point, that point will turn to green
  - (3) If the robot found the red point is not reachable, might be a wall, might be a moving obstacle, then the point will turn to black.
- The full logic of `route_follow.py`:
